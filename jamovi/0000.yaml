  Make it easy to deal with multiple cross-tables in data exploration, by
  creating them, manipulating them, and adding color helpers to highlight
  important informations (differences from totals, comparisons between lines or
  columns, contributions to variance, confidence intervals, odds ratios, etc.).
  All functions are pipe-friendly and render data frames which can be easily
  manipulated. In the same time, time-taking operations are done with
  'data.table' to go faster with big dataframes. Tables can be exported to
  'Excel', plot and html with formats and colors.
