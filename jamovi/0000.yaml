  Make it easy to deal with multiple cross-tables in data exploration, by
  creating them, manipulating them, and adding color helpers to highlight
  important informations (differences from totals, comparisons between lines or
  columns, contributions to variance, margins of error, etc.). All functions are
  pipe-friendly and render data frames which can be easily manipulated. In the
  same time, time-taking operations are done with 'data.table' to go faster with
  big dataframes. Tables can be exported to 'Excel' and in html with formats and
  colors.
