\usage{
tab_ci(
  tabs,
  ci = "auto",
  comp = NULL,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  color = "no",
  visible = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tabs}{A \code{tibble} of class \code{tab} made with \code{\link{tab_core}} or
\code{\link{tab_many}}.}

\item{ci}{The type of ci to calculate. Set to "cell" to calculate absolute confidence
intervals. Set to "diff" to calculte the confidence intervals of the difference
between a cell and the relative total cell (or the first cell,
when \code{diff = "first"} in \code{\link{tab_pct}}). By default, "diff" ci are
calculated for means and row and col percentages, "cell" ci for frequencies ("all",
"all_tabs").}

\item{comp}{Comparison level. When \code{tab_vars} are present, should \code{"diff"}
confidence intervals for rows and means be calculated for each subtable/group
(by default \code{comp = "tab"}) ? Should they be calculated for the whole table
(\code{comp = "all"}) ?
When \code{comp = "all"} and \code{diff = "first"}, cells are compared to the first
cell of the total table instead.
This parameter doesnâ€™t affect column percentages.
\code{comp} must be set once and for all the first time you use \code{\link{tab_chi2}},
\code{\link{tab_pct}} with rows, or \code{\link{tab_ci}}.}

\item{conf_level}{The confidence level, as a single numeric between 0 and 1.
Default to 0.95 (95\%).}

\item{color}{The type of colors to print, as a single string.
\itemize{
\item \code{"no"}: by default, no colors are printed
\item \code{"diff_ci"}: color pct and means based on cells differences from totals
or first cells, removing coloring when the confidence interval of this difference
is higher than the difference itself
\item \code{"after_ci"}: idem, but cut off the confidence interval from the
difference
}}

\item{visible}{By default confidence intervals are calculated and used to set colors,
but not printed. Set to \code{TRUE} to print them in the result.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} of class \code{tab}, colored based on differences (from
totals/first cells) and confidence intervals.
